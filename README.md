# Frogger-CS2110
This is a simple version of Frogger, made for Georgia Tech CS 2110

THE GAME
My game is a fairly stripped-down and simplified version of the arcade classic, "Frogger."
The objective is to make to the other side (into one of the holes), without touching the moving obstacles. You have 4 lives to do this succesfully. 

CONTROLS
The only controls are the arrow keys, which control the movement of the frog. You can also hit
"SELECT" at any time to exit to the main start screen.

Enjoy!
